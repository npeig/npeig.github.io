# EIG is an engineering-centric interest group based in Ngee Ann Polytechnic.

We endeavour to develop the skills that are frequently underdeveloped by engineers, but are exceedingly essential to place our students at a cut above the rest.
From presentation skills and networking, to research and advance systems, EIG intends to help you be more than an engineer.
